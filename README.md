# TRENDY v12 Experiment Configuration

This repository contains the auxiliary scripts required to run the TRENDY configuration on the RP23 NCI project on Gadi.

## Usage

This branch is a refactor of the original TRENDY run scripts, moving most of the work from shell scripts to Python and leaving only the master executing of stages to bash. Currently a work in progress, and not yet usable.
